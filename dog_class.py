Project name: Dog clauses
author: Samke_g2 and chatGPT

This program was created when I asked chatGPT to explain to me what classes were and it gave me an example with this dog class.
After that, it challenged me to extend the class by adding the "eat" method with some specifications.

The specifications were:
1) The method should take one parameter: food (a string).
2) If the dog eats "treat":
    - Increase energy by 5.
    - Print: "Milo loved the treat! Energy is now 105." (or whatever the new energy is).

3) If the dog eats "dog food":
    - Inccrease the energy by 10
    - Print: "Milo ate dog food. Energy is now 110."

4) If it's anything else:
    Print: "Milo didn't like that."

5) Cap the energy at 100 â€” it can't go higher.

Bonus(optional)
- Reject food if energy is already 100, and print: "Milo is full and doesn't want to eat right now."
