# First, I'll have a word


# Next, I'll have user input guessing that word


# Then a function to check if the user's word is my word
# If not, the function asks the user to guess a letter in my word, then checks if the letter is present.
# If the letter is present, the program will say so and show the position of the letter
# If not it will increment a count,
# when the count reaches 6 the user will lose the game and the word will be displayed
